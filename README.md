A tactical tile-laying game, made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), that cultivates curiosity about Muncie, Indiana ecosystems. Created by [Studio Hungus](https://github.com/studio-hungus) in collaboration with the [Ball State Immersive Learning Offices](https://www.bsu.edu/about/administrativeoffices/immersive-learning) and [Minnetrista](https://www.minnetrista.net/).

# The Studio Hungus Team

We are a multidisciplinary undergraduate team formed in Spring 2023 at [Ball State University](https://www.bsu.edu/) to create an interactive experience for our community partner, [Minnetrista](https://www.minnetrista.net/). We used [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module) and [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) methods to successfully deliver software in a 15-week time frame.

# Build Details
